# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [File System Crash Course (Video)](https://youtu.be/KN8YgJnShPM)<br>
You haven't learned about file system? No worry. This video is about will give you a glimpse idea of what file system is and files. 
The explanation is easy to comprehend and with awesome animation, this video brings fun in learning File system. (at least before you go deeper :D) 
<br>

2. [Codename: Protogon](https://www.ntfs.com/refs-basics.html)<br>
In August 1st 2012, Microsoft introduced its newest files system that is Resilient File System(ReFS). It says that ReFS is more resistent to data loss or damage, because create a copy when metadata is being edited, not like NTFS, which edits the metadata directly. 
Well, personally i have a great hope of this file system because i think the safer it is, the better it is. If you want to know the detail go see that site, and navigate through the sidebar.
<br>

3. [FAT32 againts NTFS](https://www.datto.com/blog/fat-vs-ntfs-which-is-better)<br>
The first time i had 16Gb removable storage (You probably know it as FlaskDisk) i was confused because i couldn't copy a 8Gb zip file, which is considerably large size for a file. 
Turns out that the flaskdisk's file system is FAT32, which can only transfer data up to 4Gb at one time. 
Curious right? why do FAT32 limits its transfer size capability? Why not just put it to infinity like our pc? Click that link, it will give you crystal clear information why it happened.
<br>

4. [Why Not DBMS?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-file-system-and-dbms/)<br>
DBMS does it job really well in storing and retrieving data. Why not DBMS implemented to replaced file system? It is actually is, sorry to say, a stupid question. 
But, the thought lingers on my mind for a couple of minutes and it really bothers me. In this website, you will get the explanation of dbms and file system. The website also provides point by point comparison between the two things.
<br>

5. [Data Recovery, makes your history revealed](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/know-about-data-recovery/)<br>
Have you ever wondered how computer forensics find their way to magically summon back criminal's deleted files? The answer is data recovery. OS is design to speed up everything working in a pc, including deleting files or folders. 
Basically, OS didnt revert back the binary of deleted data to all 0 or 1, it just put tag which tell that data is allowed to overwrite. Hence, The key idea of data recovery, find the tagged sector. Awesome right? if you curious about data recovery, find out in that website. 
It will tell you the detail about data recovery, including the type of data loss that can be recovered.
<br>

6. [Partioning a whole disk](https://baseline-data.com/blog/disaster-recovery-news/disk-partitioning-good-bad-techy/)<br>
Disk Partinioning is beneficial for some cases, such as you can run multiple OS in one PC. But there are also the downside of partinioning a disk. When you create a disk partition, you are more than likely to do wrong things, and this "wrong things" is irreversible. 
This website will give you consideration of disk partitioning, and tell you not to do the wrong things.
<br>

7. [Compression (Video)](https://youtu.be/M5c_RFKVkko)<br>
Zip, Tar.gz, RAR, and RAR4 have one common thing, data compression. Data compression involving a peculiar algorithm to make the data shortened and before you can access the data again you need to decompress it. The concept is the same as cryptography right? but instead alter it, we shortened it. 
This 7-minutes video will give you the big picture of how data compression really works and the professor also provide comprehensible examples. I recommend you to watch the continuation of this video which talk about entropy in compression explained by the same professor.
<br>

8. [File Allocation Method](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/file-allocation-methods/)<br>
In an Operating System, as i mentioned in point 5, everything must be fast to increase productivity. The core idea behind File Allocation is we need to utilize disk as efficient as possible and we need to be able to fetch the file block as fast as possible. In this website will tell you explanation of common kinds of file allocating method. 
Those are Contiguous Allocation, Linked List allocation, and Indexed Allocation.
<br>

9. [Acyclic-Graph Directories](http://boron.physics.metu.edu.tr/ozdogan/OperatingSystems/week11/node18.html)<br>
One of all kind of directories is Acyclic-Graph Directories. It is a generalization of tree structured directories. Consider two person have to collaborate on a project. The collaboration makes them to use the file in same subdirectories together and they want it to be in their directories. Hence, the subdirectory need to be "shared", this is where acyclic graph directories comes handy. 
This website will provide explanation of A-G directories, but beware the interface is not that good.
<br>

10. [Mounting a Remote FS (Video)](https://youtu.be/-0jyrvMl0Ic)<br>
Computer networks makes data-transfer or file sharing is able to do across the world. The World Wide Web also use data-transfer. How about mounting it?
This video is a guide to mount a remote file system using SSHFS. It is also gives a glimpse idea why its better than nfs.
