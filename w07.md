# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Critical Section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSX1YEoCVgA)<br>
Do you know what is critical section? If you dont, i recommend you to watch this video. This video gives you simple and clear explanantion about critical section and critical section problem.
<br>

2. [Mutex lock in C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/mutex/mutex/lock/)<br>
Mutex or Mutual Exclusion lock is a higher-level tools to protect critical section. This website will show you the implementation of Mutex lock in C++ so you can do it on your own. Go check it out.
<br>

3. [Semaphore S](https://www.guru99.com/semaphore-in-operating-system.html)<br>
We know that it is a non-negative variable but what does it solve? why is it important? This website will give you explanation on what is Semaphore, how it works, advantages disadvandtages, and they also give example codes.
<br>

4. [The Bounded-Buffer Problem](http://www.it.uu.se/education/course/homepage/os/vt18/module-4/bounded-buffer/)<br>
Bounded-Buffer or Producer-consumer problem is one of the classic problem that occurs in Synchronization. But what is it actually? Go to this website, they give explanation about the problem and the implementation.
<br>

5. [Transactional memory] (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/transactional_memory)<br>
Transactional Memory is one of many mechanism in concurrency synchronization. This website shows you how it works and they also give code example.
<br>

6. [Priority Inversion](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/priority-inversion)<br>
In this website, they give the explanation about priority inversion, what problems that occur from it and how to solve it.
<br>

7. [Detection-Algorithm (VIDEO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d5A_T-AQUE)<br>
This video is about explanation on Detection-Algorithm and how to use it. Go check it out.
<br>

8. [Resource preemption](https://www.ele.uri.edu/CARD/statements/threaded.html)<br>
How to break deadlocks? One of the ways is resource preemption. This website gives explanation about resource preemption and they also explain the three issues that must be considered in resource preemption.
<br>

9. [Preemptive Kernels and Nonpreemptive Kernels](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-preemptive-and-non-preemptive-kernel-in-os/)<br>
Those are two approaches to handle critical sections in OS. But what is the differences between them? Check this website out. This webiste gives comparison table between Preemptive kernels and Nonpreemptive kernels.
<br>

10. [Bankerâ€™s Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)<br>
Yes, it is used in banking system, hence the name Banker's Algorithm. As we know banker's algorithm is one of many solutions of deadlock prevention. How does it work? I recommend you to go to this website, they'll give you explanation in simply manner.
