# Top 10 List of Week 02

### **1. [The History Of Enigma Machine](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/hist.htm)**<br>
Introducing one the first modernized mechanical cryptographer(in world war 2 ...). Enigma Machine is the key role of secret communication between axis powers, before eventually cracked by Turing and Welchman, Its technique of cryptography is an outstanding work. If you curious of how this machine first developed and the progress of its improvements in world war 2, surely the article in this website is worth-to-read. 
<br>

### **2. [ALAN TURINGâ€™S LIFE](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2012/turing-biography/)**<br>
Alan Turing, as i mentioned above, one of the cracker of Enigma Machine is a brilliant human-being in the world of computer science. One of his famous work was a Turing Machine, a mathematical model of computation which is a representation of a computer. Turing personalities always remind me of not-to-have-a-goddamned-problem relationship with a quite man. Here it is folks, the link will lead you to the life of Alan Turing but please bear this in mind that the way he died is very unfortunate.
<br>

### **3. [Spear-Phising still works on Twitter](https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/what-the-twitter-hack-reveals-about-spear-phishing-and-how-to-prevent-it/)**<br>
Hey! do you know Twitter got hit last year? The consequences was huge, not only the attackers managed to access several account of celebrity and famous people, they got away with lot of money in bitcoin. To think a giant company got a data breach is beyond imagination, but how exacty they do it? A perfect and beautiful match between social-engineering and old-school phising, the attackers managed to bewitch twitter employees giving them access to the internal portal. I don't know about you guys but i feel thrilled to know the details about the spear-phising attacks. That link will give you a hint of knowledge about what spear-phising is and what happened in the world of cyber security.
<br>

### **4. [Defense in Depth](https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/defense-depth)**<br>
One of the Principles of Protection is Defense in Depth. Build multiple layer of defense or security is the main idea of Defense in Depth. This website will give you the details of what Defense in Depth is, the elements of Defense in Depth, and tell you what to put as the first line of defense.
<br>

### **5. [DAC or MAC(not the machintos)](https://www.ekransystem.com/en/blog/mac-vs-dac)**<br>
Access control is a method to say a user what they are. It gives authorization and authentication to certain individuals for accessing the information that they allowed to access. Mandatory Access Control and Discretionally access control are two kinds of Access control. Both have advantages and disadvantages. So which to use? Read the article in the website to find out the answers.
<br>

### **6. [Secure Hash Algorithms](https://brilliant.org/wiki/secure-hashing-algorithms/)**<br>
Abbreviated as SHA, Secure Hash Algorithm is a function to keep data secure. The main idea is to alter the contents of data by using a hash function. It uses bitwise operation and everything that we learn in discrete math in the first semester. Find more in this link, you will find explanation of several of its kind.
<br>

### **7. [When Internet Goes Down](https://theconversation.com/when-the-internet-goes-down-92481)**<br>
We have been living with the internet side by side for the past decades, ever wonder what will happened if it goes down? It would be really scary right? This article will give you explanation about several possibilities that cause the down of internet and the consequences of the action.
<br>

### **8. [Transport Layer Security (Video)](https://youtu.be/0TLDTodL7Lc)**<br>
Transport Layer Security or TLS is everywhere right now. Basically it is protocol to provide security over the computer network or so you called internet. It aims privacy and data integrity between two or more computer applications. This video gives you a little history and clear detail about TLS.
<br>

### **9. [Password Cracking (Video)](https://youtu.be/7U-RbOKanYs)**<br>
We agreed that a password to access our property should be really strong and very secure. It is the first barrier to prevent other people whom we don't want to get through. Despite all of our might to create a strong password, it is still possible to be cracked. If you are interested in how a password is cracked, click the link on the title it will give you a video about password cracking in theory and in practical manners.
<br>
